# The_most_expensive_players

Hello

I made this project for learning purposes. I was curious in detail about information about contained in excel data file which I found on kaggle.com website.
I wanted to practise a skills related to programming, be more familiar with pandas, plotly functions, remind a pure python funtion and last but not least learn new things related creating a dashboards. I found a library Streamlit which is looking very friendly for new users and offering great documentation with a lot of examples, but that library has some limitations related to visualisation (diffrent background colors than white or black).

Content of my dashboard:
⚪Top10 the most expensive players

⚪Top10 on each position

⚪Which country has the biggest amount of the most expensive players

⚪Age distribution in that ranking

⚪The most expensive senior player (30 years+)

⚪The most expensive teenager (U21)
